## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community to help make QLC+ even better. Before diving into coding, we encourage you to start a discussion in our [Software Development](https://www.qlcplus.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=12) forum if you're considering adding a new feature or making significant changes. This provides an opportunity for feedback, collaboration, and ensuring alignment with the project's goals.

## Compiling & Installation

If you're compiling QLC+ from sources and you regularly do "git pull"
to get the latest sources, you probably end up seeing some
compiler warnings and errors from time to time. Since the whole source package
is under development, you might even encounter unresolved symbols etc. If such a thing occurs, you should do a "make
distclean" on qlcplus (top-most source directory) and then "qmake" and "make"
again. We attempt to keep the GIT master free of fatal errors and it should
compile all the time. However, some inter-object dependencies do get mixed up
sometimes and you need to compile the whole package instead of just the latest
changes. Sometimes even that doesn't work, because QLC+ installs its common
libraries to system directories, where (at least unixes) fetch them instead
of the source directory. In those cases, you might try going to the libs
directory, compile it with "make" and install with "make install" and then
attempt to re-compile the whole package with "make".
